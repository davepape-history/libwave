<h1>
libwave - Wavefront/GL rendering library
</h1>
<h3> Version 1.4.1
 <br> 12 January 1996
 <br> by Dave Pape (pape@evl.eecs.uic.edu)
</h3>


<b>libwave</b> is a library for reading Wavefront .obj object files
and rendering them with IrisGL. It supports basic geometry (faces and lines),
and materials and texture maps, as far as is possible with
IrisGL (i.e. no bump maps, reflection, or refraction).
<p>
The typical application can make use of the library with just two
function calls, as in the following code excerpt:
<pre>
	#include "wave.h"
	...
	wfObject *obj;
	obj = wfReadObject("foo.obj");
	...
	winopen();
	/* Initialize GL - RGB, Zbuffering, lights, etc. */
	...
	wfDrawObject(obj);
	...
</pre>
<p>
More daring programmers can access and/or modify the object data itself,
as stored in the <i>wfObject</i> structure. Such use is not currently documented
here; see the source code (wave.h and the sample program wfaddtex.c) for
details.
<p>
The most current version of the library (libwave.a and wave.h) can always
be found in ~pape/lib at EVL.
<p>
<a href="libwave.tar.Z">libwave.tar.Z</a> contains the library and source
code, as well as some sample applications. To use the library as is, you
merely need to extract the files wave.h and libwave.a.
<br>
<b>wfdraw</b> (built from main.c &amp; spin.c) displays Wavefront
objects, allowing you to move and spin them with the mouse.
<b>wfbounds</b> will print out the bounding box and bounding sphere
information for an object.
<b>wfaddtex</b> adds texture mapping to an object, with several different
simple methods for generating the texture coordinates.


<h2>Functions:</h2>

<dl>

<dt><i>wfObject * wfReadObject(char * filename)</i>
<dd>
  Reads the obj file <i>filename</i> and stores all the geometry, material,
and texture data in a wfObject structure. A pointer to the structure is
returned; this pointer should be passed to <i>wfDrawObject()</i> to render the
object. All associated files (material & texture libraries) should be in
the current directory, or have their full path included in the obj file.


<dt><i>void wfDrawObject(wfObject * object)</i>
<dd>
  Renders the object using GL. <i>wfInitObject()</i> will be called automatically
if the object has not already been initialized. 


<dt><i>void wfInitObject(wfObject * object)</i>
<dd>
  Initializes the GL data for an object - ie defines any materials or
textures that the object uses. This normally does not need to be called
directly by an application; however, if the object is stored in shared
memory (via <i>wfSetMemoryAllocator()</i>) and is used in multiple processes
(as in the CAVE), this *should* be called directly, to make sure that all
processes do the initialization.


<dt><i>void wfGetBoundingSphere(wfObject *obj,wfVertex center,float *radius)</i>
<dd>
  Returns a bounding sphere for an object, in the form of a center point
and a radius. The sphere's center is the average of all the vertices in
the object; the radius is the distance from the center to the farthest
vertex.


<dt><i>void wfGetBoundingBox(wfObject *obj,wfVertex corner0,wfVertex corner1)</i>
<dd>
  Returns an axis-aligned bounding box for an object. <i>corner0</i> is the
minimum X, Y, and Z coordinates of the object's vertices; <i>corner1</i> is
the maximum X, Y, and Z coordinates.


<dt><i>void wfSetMemoryAllocator(void * (*allocfn)(size_t),void (*freefn)(void *))</i>
<dd>
  Defines the memory allocation and de-allocation functions which will be
used by <i>wfReadObject()</i> when creating an object. The default functions are
<i>malloc()</i> and <i>free()</i>. This can be used to make objects be stored in shared
memory.


<dt><i>void wfSetNewIDFunction(int (*newidfn)(void))</i>
<dd>
  Defines the function which the library will call to obtain unique
material and texture IDs. An internally provided function is used by
default. If you have some function that is used by other drawing
routines to select IDs, this can be used to have the library call that
same function and thus prevent ID collisions.


<dt><i>void wfWriteObject(FILE *fp,wfObject *obj)</i>
<dd>
  Writes an object to a file. <i>fp</i> should be a pointer to a file opened
for writing; <i>obj</i> is a pointer to the object. The vertices, normals,
texture vertices, faces, lines, mtllib/usemtl, and maplib/usemap entries
will be written; all other parts of the original obj file (comments,
groups, etc) are not stored in the wfObject structure.


<dt><i>void wfEnable(int id)</i>
<dt><i>void wfDisable(int id)</i>
<dd>
  Enables or disables certain features. Possible values for <i>id</i> and their
meanings are:
<ul>
<li><b>	WF_SHOW_DEFINED_TEXTURES</b>  -  When textures are defined during an
		object's initialization, the images are lrectwritten to
		the framebuffer, if this is enabled.
		You will probably want to use <i>frontbuffer(TRUE)</i>
		when an object is initialized with this feature.
		Disabled by default.
<li><b>	WF_USE_TEXTURES</b>  -  Whether or not to define & bind textures for objects.
		This can be toggled at any time during execution, but if it will
		be enabled, you should make sure that it is enabled when objects
		are initialized.
		Enabled by default.
<li><b>	WF_DRAW_WIREFRAME</b>  -  If enabled, polygons will be drawn as wireframe
		outlines (using GL lines) rather than solid polygons. Textures
		and normals are still used in wireframe mode.
		Disabled by default.
</ul>

<dt><i>int wfIsEnabled(int id)</i>
<dd>
  Returns the current state (0 or 1) of a feature controlled by
<i>wfEnable()</i> / <i>wfDisable()</i>.


<dt><i>wfObject * wfCopyObjectGeometry(wfObject *obj)</i>
<dd>
  Creates a copy of an object with distinct geometry data, but the
same topology and texture data.
A new wfObject struct and new arrays for the vertex and normal data
are allocated, and the values are copied from <i>obj</i>.
The texture coordinate array and 'parts' list (the list of all the
faces and material/texture invocations) entries of the new wfObject
are the same pointers as in <i>obj</i>.

<dt><i>void wfTranslateObject(wfObject *obj,float tx,float ty,float tz)</i>
<dd>
  Modifies the vertex position data of an object to
translate it by <i>(tx,ty,tz)</i>.


<dt><i>void wfRotateObject(wfObject *obj,float angle,float x,float y,float z)</i>
<dd>
  Modifies the vertex position and normal data of an object to
rotate it around the axis <i>(x,y,z)</i> by <i>angle</i> degrees.

<dt><i>void wfScaleObject(wfObject *obj,float sx,float sy,float sz)</i>
<dd>
  Modifies the vertex position data of an object to
scale it by <i>(sx,sy,sz)</i>.

<dt><i>void wfDeformObject(wfObject *obj,void (*vertFunc)(float *),void (*normFunc)(float *))</i>
<dd>
  Modifies the vertex position and normal data of an object using
application-provided deformation functions.
<i>vertFunc</i> should take a single vertex (a pointer to 3 floats) and
modify the values in place. <i>normFunc</i> should operate similarly on
a normal vector. These functions are applied to all of the vertices
and normals in the object in turn.
Either of these function pointers may be NULL if they are not to be used.

<dt><i>void wfComputeNormals(wfObject *obj,int smooth,int clockwise)</i>
<dd>
  Computes the normals for an object and adds them to all the faces;
any existing normals will be removed.
If the flag <i>smooth</i> is false, normals will be computed on a per-face,
rather than per-vertex, basis; if it is true, each vertex's normal will be
computed as the average of the normals of all the faces that include the vertex.
If the flag <i>clockwise</i> is true, the function will assume that each
face's vertices are listed in clockwise order; otherwise, it will assume
counter-clockwise ordering.

<dt><i>wfFace *wfRayIntersection(wfObject *obj,float ray0[3],float raydelta[3],float *ret_t)</i>
<dd>
  Computes the intersection of a ray with an object. The ray is described
by a starting point <i>ray0</i> and a direction vector <i>raydelta</i>.
The function will test each face of the object for an intersection, and
will return a pointer to the intersected face which is nearest to <i>ray0</i>.
<i>ret_t</i> returns the parametric position of the intersection point on
the ray; i.e. the point of intersection is <i>ray0 + (*ret_t) * raydelta</i>.
Only intersection points in the positive direction of the ray
(<i>*ret_t</i> &gt; 0) are considered.
If no face is intersected, NULL is returned and <i>*ret_t</i> is untouched.
If <i>ret_t</i> is NULL, it is ignored.

<dt><i>int wfRayHits(wfObject *obj,float *ray0,float *raydelta)</i>
<dd>
  Determines whether a ray intersects an object. The ray is defined
and the intersection tested as in <i>wfRayIntersection()</i>, however
this function merely returns 1 if any face is intersected, and 0 if
no face is intersected. This will be faster than <i>wfRayIntersection()</i>
when there is an intersection.

</dl>

<h2>Data Types</h2>
<dl>
<dt><i>wfObject</i>
<dd>
A struct containing pointers to all the data for an object. This can
generally be treated as opaque; see the definition in wave.h if you
wish to access the data it contains.
<dt><i>wfVertex</i>
<dd>
An array of 3 floats, containing vertex position data (X/Y/Z).
</dl>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
 Wavefront texture maps are not supported. Instead, all texture maps are
assumed to be SGI format images; if a filename ending in ".tex" is given
in a map specification, the ".tex" is replaced by ".sgi". Ambient,
specular, and bump maps are not supported; only diffuse & dissolve maps are.
The '-s' and '-o' options of .map files are supported, but they must
include all three scale or offset values (e.g. '-o .5 .2 0').
<p>

 Rendering an object (in <i>wfDrawObject()</i>) involves stepping through a linked
list of the geometry and other data; putting the wfDrawObject call into a GL
object (see <i>makeobj()</i>) can give a big win in rendering speed.
<p>

 <i>wfReadObject()</i> calls <i>strtok()</i> to parse lines in the obj file.
This may cause a conflict if your code also uses <i>strtok()</i> while calling
<i>wfReadObject()</i>.
<p>

 Only <i>wfInitObject()</i> and <i>wfDrawObject()</i> make any GL calls.
All other functions can be used without a window.
